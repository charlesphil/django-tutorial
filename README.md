## Development Notes

This project was created using Django 4.0.6.

Django 4.0 requires at least [Python 3.8 or higher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/faq/install/#faq-python-version-support). I recommend using something like [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python installations for your projects.

I highly recommend using a virtual environment of your choosing (I used the built-in [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) and installing the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
